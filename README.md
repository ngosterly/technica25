# technica25

Personality / emotion music recommender — UI built with React + Vite.

## About

This repository (`technica25`) contains a React + Vite application used as the frontend for a personality/emotion-based music recommender prototype.

## Template Information

This project uses the React + Vite template which provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel (or oxc when used in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh

### React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance. To add it, see the React documentation: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

For production applications we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. See the Vite TS template for details on integrating TypeScript and `typescript-eslint`:
